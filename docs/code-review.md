# Best Practices for Peer Code Review

Original article from Cisco : [BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf](https://www.kessler.de/prd/smartbear/BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf)

## Summary of the article

### 1. "Review fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time within 60-90min, 70-90% defect"

--> **Don't review too much at the same time**

### 2. "Aim for an inspection rate of less than 300-500 LOC/hour** (6-8 LOC/mn!)"

--> **Don't review too quickly**

### 3. "Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more than 60-90 minutes"

--> **Don't spend too much time**

### 4. Authors should annotate source code before the review begins

--> **Describe your dev**

- Authors might be able to eliminate most defects themselves. They should "prepare" the CR by annotating code. These comments are not *code comments* but *comments for reviewers*.
- By doing so, they find themselves potential bugs in their devs.
- Potential explanation of why fewer bugs: where there are comments, the reviewers is "biased" and see less bugs (because his spirit has been anchored to the developer interpretation). But after investigation, this is not the case.

### 5. Establish quantifiable goals for code review and capture metrics so you can improve your processes

--> **Measure the impact of the CR**

### 6. Checklists substantially improve results for both authors and reviewers

### 7. Verify that defects are actually fixed!

### 8. Managers must foster a good code review culture in which finding defects is viewed positively

- Easy to see defects negatively (mistakes in the code), but it should be seen as a positive mean for *learning, growing and communication*.
- It's not an accusation way of working: the *author* mades the bugs and the *reviewer* saw it, but more as en efficient pair-programming session.
- To maintain a consistent message that finding bugs is good, management must promise that defect densities will never be used in performance reports

### 9. Beware the “Big Brother” effect

### 10. The Ego Effect: Do at least some code review, even if you don’t have time to review it all

The Ego Effect: knowing that your code will be reviewed makes you more conscientious before pushing your work. This effect is also the case even if the review is not compulsory: reviewing 20-30% of the code would probably be optimal to assure the Ego Effect with minimal time expenditure.

### 11. Lightweight-style code reviews are efficient, practical, and effective at finding bugs

    --> GitHub is pretty nice!
